# JournalAnalyzer
A Python program for transcribing, storing, and analyzing journal entries

# Goals
I have a journal that I write in every day, and I'd like to have a tool to analyze it. This is just a hobby project, but I picture the workflow for this to be as such:  
1) Someone records themselves reading their journal entries. They read the date and then the journal entry
2) The program looks in a folder for these recordings, breaks them into smaller files, and then transcribes them. With each transcription it figures out the date and puts the entry (in addition to the MP3 data) into a database
3) Once the database is populated with the specific journal entries, the analysis can occur
4) The user is able to ask things like, "What was I doing on June 22, 2021?" or "Can you tell me some emotions I experienced in June?" or "When did I go to France?"

Ultimately, I would also like to create an iOS app that sorts journal entries, provides the analysis capability, and associates the recordings with each entry. It's an archival tool, and it would be fun to use this as a reflection tool, as well. "Where did I spend most of my 2022?"
